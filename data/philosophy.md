# MJ Philosophy

MJ Software is not built to be famous.  
It is built to be faithful.

This tool is a reflection of a quiet journey—crafted not for recognition, but for resonance.  
It honors the dignity of low-resource devices, the autonomy of the individual, and the ethics of transparency.

MJ believes:
- Technology must serve, not dominate.
- Silence is a valid interface.
- Every action should be publicly auditable.
- Minimalism is not a limitation—it is clarity.

MJ Software is not a product.  
It is a practice.
